## Installation
Installation is a complex and nuanced process, best done by a highly trained artisans who wear special hats. The artisans were separated from their parents at a young age, and put in a drafty house with stern nuns and an installation of `pip` as their only companions. The full instructions to pluck this beautiful, platonic ideal of a project from the theoretic plane --- upon which it is happily frolicking --- down into the grimy, material world of men and fingerprint-smudges on screens are inscribed on (gluten-free) rice paper, written with brushes made from the hair of Richard Stallman with ink from unreasonably-priced wild berries and fruits. Only 15<sup>th</sup>-century Daoist monks could be entrusted with the sacred act of codifying these instructions, in calligraphy so beautiful that it makes your handwriting look like the work of a Koala with palsy. The monks' bodies were brought to life using skill, finesse, and ancient mosquitoes preserved in amber, while an eccentric Jeff Goldblum looked upon skeptically. We were very lucky the monks we found knew Markdown. (It is worth noting that although the instructions are in Markdown, when looked upon with the corner of the eye, a discerning, debonair, and devilishly handsome observer will see them occasionally shift into other languages, particularly LIPS, Biblical Hebrew, and pure geometry. 
Be careful --- Legend Has It that one who was unworthy once looked upon and attempted to copy-and-paste these otherworldly instructions into his text editor. His computer no longer works, and only shows the scene from _2001: A Space Odyssey_ in which Dave goes into the monolith, on loop, forever. The man can no longer speak nor read, but only play the glass harmonica and glare at classical statuary to express himself. 
If you are brave, if you do not fear the fate of those who tried and failed before you, then dare to gaze upon and experience the Way to Installation --- nay --- to Enlightenment itself!
